# LC2KDebug
## (beta)
## A Javascript debugger for the LC2K ISA
#
### How do I use this?

* First select all the assembly files (LC2K source code files)
* Reorder them to the original linked order in the top bar (drag on the filenames to reorder) if there are multiple source code files
* Select the final (linked) machine code file
* The debugger will start executing your code
* Control the debugger with the buttons at the bottom bar or using the keyboard shortcuts below
* Breakpoints can be added by clicking the required line
* The current values in the registers and memory can be viewed on the right
* The values on the stack can also be viewed on the right
* To increase the number of memory values visible on the stack, drag the slider towards the right (the number of memory values visible increases by a factor of 2 each time)
